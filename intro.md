A document detailing wonderful world of Minecraft in March 2020, to help us choose the most fun MC setup for our quarantine time.

## Why Minecraft?

- low barrier to entry in cost/device performance
- drop in/drop out gameplay
- no gamer rage so Steve/Scott/Gavin don't smash peripherals
- trains - lots and lots of trains. Seriously Ayn Rand would love this game.

But moreso, I will also advocate that we play a modded version of Minecraft.
Don't worry if you've not done it before, it's incredibly easy today!

## Why modded Minecraft?

Obviously we need accounts for the Java version of MC.
We all seem to already have those, and if you want to play vanilla you just use the vanilla launcher and a vanilla server, like the other night on Roddy's server.

But vanilla is just the tip of the Minecraft iceberg.
Mods and mod packs are the life-blood of the game; personally speaking I've found good mod packs to be considerably more fun than vanilla, especially on small-to-medium sized co-op servers with friends. It's cool to show off the different things you're building!

e.g. I focus on building industrial stuff from tech mods, meanwhile Lauren is exploring caves for rare materials, meanwhile Will has built a wizard's tower and is creating powerful magics.
I can provide Will with mass materials to build his tower and fuel his dark machines, and he in turn can provide Lauren with powerful spells and equipment to go spelunking, who finds us rare stuff to build even more powerful or cool machines.

Can get real satisfying. Ultimately, the extra variety that the mods provide really enhance the "look at this cool thing I made!" response of the game, which is the most fun part about MC.
