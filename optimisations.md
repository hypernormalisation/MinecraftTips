# Minecraft optimisations

Now L has her new Ryzen rig and A will be installing minecraft on their machine with a gpu, things are looking up - none of us are liable to be CPU or RAM limited if you are playing on the server.

L, hoever, was playing last night on some of relatviely medium settings was getting some FPS spikes and low FPS in general.
Minecarf can be a daunting application for configure, with probably over one hundred settings.
To get around this I've come up with some options to configure that are utter performance gluttons, but that don't really add that much to the game.

I've also had an impression that the shaders we are using could be supoptimal, so have been investigating some that look just as lovely, but are less CPU/GPU intensitve.

The new shaders I've been looking at are:


So who is this article for?
- anyone wanting to try out new shader packs to see how things look and feel (recommanded)
- or if your game isn't consistently hitting 50-60fps.

## Some testing.

I have a reasonably powerful machine, so it's hard to properly test how certain configurations will run on certain hardware.
To mitigate this a little, I'm using the application MSI Afterburner application to track my GPU usage, as well as memory consumption.

Now, this is obviously not a perfect map - some GPUs are better at some things than others, especially between hardware generations.
But should give a decent idea of how a modern GPU handles minecraft with shaders and good resource packs running.

In each test I will run around a single player world for a while and not the max GPU and RAM usages.

I will do so for a permutation of:
- in game settings
- texture pack size
- shader pack

## Some key video settings
All these checks are run with me running SEUS shaders, 128x texture packs, on 1080p.

### Specific settings.
- graphics (fast/fancy): 5-20 frmea benefit depending on location, no visible difference to me/

## Texture packs

The texture (sometimes called "resource" packs) we use are chosen because they generally match up between the mods (Extended Caves we're looking at you), and they're not total eyesores.

I have complete texture packs for 128x, 64x and 32x. With some older cards we might see some real improvements in the 32x packs, so will be giving them a try.
